In React Router Dom v6, navigating to a route with a dynamic segment that includes a special character like a '+' symbol can lead to unexpected behavior or prevent the route from matching correctly.  The issue stems from how the route matching algorithm handles these characters.  For instance, a route defined as `/users/:id` might fail to match `/users/+123` because the '+' is interpreted literally rather than as part of the dynamic :id segment.
